We’re hiring a full-time Product Designer to work with us on a wide variety of product design work related to the web-based Simple Dashboard (for health administrators), the Simple mobile app (for healthcare workers), and the BP Passport mobile app (for patients).

You will wear many hats in this role. The weight of your work will be product design and dashboard data visualization, but you should be ready to jump in on other tasks as necessary.

In a typical month you may document the definition of a new key indicator, communicate the release of a new feature to health officials, iterate on designs for a new Dashboard visualization, work with engineers to implement a new feature, and prepare a Figma prototype to test a new idea with healthcare workers in India.

Your primary responsibility will be owning the design of the web-based Simple Dashboard. You will help ensure the hypertension and diabetes reports are simple, easy-to-use, and highlight actionable improvement areas. Fundamentally the entire “Simple” system is designed as a feedback loop engine to help healthcare workers and health system administrators drive positive change. Your goal is to create a Dashboard that quickly puts actionable insights into those peoples’ hands.
